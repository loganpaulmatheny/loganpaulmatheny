# Logan
Hi I'm Logan! I'm a software engineer, future dad, and veteran. I'm motivated to make the world and my communities a better place through leveraging my unique talents of problem solving and effective leadership. I'm a naturally curious person that loves to find ways to make things simple, efficient, and effective. When I'm not working, I'm probably reading, running, or spending time with family.

## My values 
☀️ Staying positive  
👏 Working as effective leader and teammember  
🌱 Maintain a growth mindset and always seek to improve  
🦮 Service to your team, loved ones, and community  

## How I work 
I believe that supportive environments where everyone feels respected and appreciated lead to amazing results. I manage my time well and work to maintain balance in all aspects of my life. If I or others have roadblocks or problems whether they be personal or professional I enourage respectful candor so we can solve those challenges together.
